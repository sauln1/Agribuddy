# v1.2.2 UPDATE NOTES

### In v1.2.2 we're fixing some bugs related to the orientation of the card and adding a feature for indoor plants, enabling users to assign grow beds as either "Indoor" or "Outdoor" where indoor plants will not be impacted by rainfall.
---
## Features

- **Plant database** — search 440,000+ plant species and 15,000+ cultivated varieties via the [Verdantly Gardening API](https://verdantly.io/docs/introduction). Includes care instructions, hardiness zones, soil and pH preferences, harvest timing, mature size, growth type, toxicity warnings, and more.
- **Grow plots** — organize plants into named beds or containers, including a built-in **Unassigned** plot. See at a glance which plants live where, and reassign a plant's plot from a dropdown in its details.
- **Plant Profile radar** — each plant's drill-down shows a six-spoke radar chart plus a bar legend rating Sunlight, Water, Zones, Size, and Growth (0–2 each) and an overall Care score (0–10). Missing data shows as a dash with an empty bar.
- **Care instructions** — collapsible sections for **Start Indoors**, **Transplant Outdoors**, **Direct Sow**, and **Harvesting**. Sections with no data are hidden.
- **Per-plant calendar** — open a plant to see its own **Week** grid (events + weather dots) and **Season** timeline. The Season view is a single continuous "bubble" line that changes color across the plant's lifecycle (seed/indoor start → transplant → harvest/removed), with a year stepper.
- **Watering automation** — each plant gets a per-species watering schedule (e.g. "Moderate" = 3–7 days). Plants overdue for water surface as "Thirsty" with a 💧 badge. Rain detected on your weather entity counts as a watering automatically, so your plants don't get marked thirsty after a storm.
- **Frost protection** — plants enter a "Frost danger" state when your weather entity forecasts freezing temperatures tonight. Status icon turns red on the dashboard.
- **Plant statuses** — exposed on each plant's sensor entity, easily added to automations or scenes: `scheduled`, `healthy`, `thirsty`, `danger`, `harvested`, `removed`.
- **Per-plot "all thirsty" sensor** — each real grow plot gets a binary sensor that turns **on** when every plant in it is thirsty, for whole-bed irrigation automations.
- **Hardiness zone** — enter your zone range (any system) in Settings; it surfaces as a "Zone" pill on the main view.
- **6-month soft delete + archival** — removing a plant keeps its species data for 6 months so you can re-add the same variety with zero API calls. After 6 months, a slim history record (name, dates, events) is preserved indefinitely so your seasonal history never disappears. All data stored locally.
- **User overrides** — Verdantly missing a value or just wrong for your specific plant? Override any field per-plant via the trading card's Edit details overlay. Original Verdantly data stays cached; overrides are layered on top (new plants can be suggested to Verdantly via their website).
- **Themed Lovelace card** — modern card design with a blue/dark-grey **Default** theme (orange accents) and a **Home Assistant** theme that follows your HA theme variables. Auto / portrait / landscape layout toggle.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2025.12 or later
- A weather entity (HA's built-in weather integration, MQTT weather sensor, template, or any entity exposing the standard weather attributes)
- A free RapidAPI account + Verdantly Gardening API subscription. See setup below. It is highly recommended to purchase a higher tier for the Verdantly API for larger gardens or setups!

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Go to **Integrations** → click the **⋮** menu → **Custom repositories**.
3. Add this repository URL with category **Integration**:
   `https://github.com/sauln1/agribuddy`
4. Search for "Agribuddy" in HACS and install it.
5. Restart Home Assistant.
6. Repeat steps 2–4 under HACS → **Frontend** to install the [dashboard card](https://github.com/sauln1/agribuddy-card).

### Manual install

1. Download the latest release zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/sauln1/agribuddy/releases) page and the card [Release-Agribuddy-Card](https://github.com/sauln1/agribuddy-card/releases).
2. Extract into your HA config directory so you have:
   - `config/custom_components/agribuddy/` (the integration)
   - `config/www/agribuddy-card/` (the dashboard card)
3. Add the card resource in HA: **Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ → Resources → Add resource**:
   - URL: `/local/agribuddy-card/agribuddy-card.js?v=1`
   - Resource type: **JavaScript Module**
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

### 1. Get a Verdantly API key (free)

1. Go to [RapidAPI's Verdantly Gardening API page](https://rapidapi.com/verdantly-team-verdantly-team-default/api/verdantly-gardening-api).
2. Sign up for a free RapidAPI account.
3. Subscribe to the **Basic (Free)** plan — 25 API calls per month, no credit card required.
4. Ensure your RapidAPI app/console is set to API "V1".
5. Copy your **X-RapidAPI-Key** from the dashboard. This is what Agribuddy needs.

### 2. Add the integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Agribuddy**.
3. Paste your RapidAPI key when prompted. Agribuddy doesn't validate the key on setup (validation would burn 1 of your 25 monthly calls) — the first plant search will surface any auth issues.
4. Pick your weather entity. Any entity works — a `weather.*` entity, a sensor that exposes temperature/precipitation attributes, a template entity, etc.
5. (Optional) Enter your **Hardiness Zone Range** — two free-text values (low and high). This is purely for display on the card's "Zone" pill and can be changed later from either the integration's options or the card's Settings.

### 3. Add the card to your dashboard

1. Edit your dashboard → **+ Add Card** → search for **Agribuddy**.
2. (Optional) Set a card title and starting layout. Defaults are sensible.
3. Save.

The integration creates one sensor entity per added plant: `sensor.<plant_name>` with state `healthy` / `thirsty` / `danger` / `harvested` / `removed` / `scheduled`, and one binary sensor per grow plot: `binary_sensor.<grow_plot_name>_all_thirsty` with state `on` / `off`. Use these directly in automations.

## NOTE: Free Tier API call budget (the 25/month free tier)

Verdantly's free Basic plan caps you at **25 API calls per month**. Agribuddy is built around this constraint with aggressive caching. Upgrade to a paid RapidAPI tier for more calls. The integration works agnostic of selected plan.

After upgrading to v1.2.0, opening a plant added under an older version triggers a **one-time** refresh of that plant's data (1 API call) so its radar profile and care instructions populate. This happens only when you open the plant, and only once per plant.

---

## How statuses work

Each plant's sensor reports one of six states:

| State | When | Color | Icon |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scheduled` | `start_date` is in the future | Blue | 📅 |
| `healthy` | Default — watered recently, no frost | Green | 🌱 |
| `thirsty` | `days_since_watered ≥ watering_min_days` | Orange | 💧 |
| `danger` | Frost forecast on weather entity | Red | ❄️ |
| `harvested` | Harvest event logged — terminal until plant deleted | Grey | 🧺 |
| `removed` | Removed event logged (plant died / was pulled) — terminal until plant deleted | Dark grey | 🥀 |

Each grow plot also gets a binary sensor (`binary_sensor.<grow_plot_name>_all_thirsty`):

| State | When |
|---|---|
| `off` | Default — at least one plant in the plot is not thirsty (or the plot is empty) |
| `on` | Every plant in the plot is thirsty and needs watering |

Frost takes precedence over thirsty (more urgent). Removed trumps harvested (a removed plant wasn't harvested).

The watering threshold values are estimated lengths of time that derive from Verdantly's `waterRequirement` field:
- **Low** → check every 7–14 days
- **Moderate** → check every 3–7 days
- **High** → check every 1–3 days

Both bounds are per-plant overridable in the trading card's Edit details overlay.

Rain detected on your weather entity counts as a watering — Agribuddy logs a `rain_detected` event automatically and the plant's badge shows 🌧 (blue) for a few days afterward.

---

## Plant start types

When you add a plant, you choose how it was started. This drives the Season timeline's starting color:

| Start type | Meaning | Season color |
|---|---|---|
| `seed` | Direct-sown from seed | Green |
| `indoor_start` | Started indoors before transplanting | Purple |
| `transplant` | Added as an established transplant | Blue |

The Season timeline then shifts color at each logged milestone: **transplant** (blue), **harvest** (yellow), and **removed** (dark grey).

---

## The Plant Profile radar

Each plant's drill-down replaces the old image with a radar chart + bar legend. Five metrics are scored 0–2, and Care is their combined 0–10 total:

| Metric | Source | Scoring |
|---|---|---|
| **Sunlight** | `sunlightRequirement` | Shade 0 · Partial 1 · Full 2 |
| **Water** | `waterRequirement` | Low 0 · Moderate 1 · High 2 |
| **Zones** | `growingZoneRange` | 0.25 per zone in the range, capped at 2 |
| **Size** | `matureHeight` | 0.25 per 5 units of height, capped at 2 |
| **Growth** | `growthPeriod` + `growthType` | Annual / indeterminate raise the score; perennial / determinate lower it (0–2) |
| **Care** | all of the above | Sum of the five metrics (0–10) → Low / Medium / High |

When Verdantly doesn't supply a value, that metric shows a dash and an empty bar rather than a guessed score.

## Agribuddy Card

This integration is meant to be used with the [Agribuddy-card companion](https://github.com/sauln1/agribuddy-card).

## Layout
<img alt="agribuddy-main" src="https://github.com/sauln1/Agribuddy/blob/8b7119f78f63657dcf4a51c8b0db67b970f5e357/main_view.png" />

The card supports three layouts:

- **Auto** (default) — adapts based on screen width. Viewport ≤ 600px → portrait, larger → landscape.
- **Portrait** — phone-optimized. Metrics in 2×2 grid, plant list as a card stack.
- **Landscape** — desktop/tablet optimized. Metrics in a 4-across row.

Set via **Settings → Card display → Layout** (Bootstrap-style toggle group). Preference is per-browser (localStorage).

Two themes are available via **Settings → Card display → Theme**:

- **Home Assistant** — follows your HA theme variables, so custom HA themes are respected.
- **Default** — Agribuddy's own blue/dark-grey surface design with an orange accent.

Theme is also per-browser (localStorage).

---

## Available services

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `agribuddy.add_plant` | Add a plant. Used internally by the card; can be called from automations to bulk-import. |
| `agribuddy.remove_plant` | Soft-delete a plant (keeps cache 6 months, then archives history-only forever). |
| `agribuddy.log_event` | Log an event (watered, fertilized, pest, snow, indoor_start, sprouted, harvested, transplanted, removed, other). |
| `agribuddy.remove_event` | Remove a previously logged event. |
| `agribuddy.update_plant` | Edit plant metadata (name, start type, start date, grow plot, etc.). Re-anchors the calendar's "planted" marker if start_date changes. |
| `agribuddy.update_plant_overrides` | Set per-plant Verdantly field overrides. Empty string removes an override. |

See HA's **Developer Tools → Services** for the full schema of each.

## Storage layout

Agribuddy stores data in `.storage/agribuddy.plants`:

```json
{
  "plants":          { "<id>": { ... full plant record ... }, ... },
  "plots":           { "<id>": { ... plot record ... }, ... },
  "archived_plants": { "<id>": { slim history record }, ... },
  "weather_log":     { "2026-05-12": {"rain": true, "snow": false, ...}, ... }
}
```

Soft-deleted plants stay in `plants` for 180 days with a `deleted_at` timestamp; their species data continues feeding the Recent Plants chip strip. After 180 days, `_archive_old_deleted_plants()` moves them to `archived_plants` as slim history records keeping only id/name/start_date/end_date/end_status/events.

Your hardiness zone range and weather entity are stored on the integration's config entry (not in the file above). API usage tracking lives in `.storage/agribuddy.api_usage` keyed by `YYYY-MM` and resets at the start of each month.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"404 Error" code** — if you are getting a 404 error code when adding a new plant, this is usually due to not having the integration set up completely. Make sure you complete Step 2 under Setup.

**"Verdantly rejected this key"** — the key is wrong or you haven't subscribed to the Verdantly Gardening API on RapidAPI. Double-check by visiting the API page on RapidAPI and confirming the **Subscribe** button shows "Subscribed".

**"⛔ quota exhausted"** — you've hit your maximum number of calls for the month. Wait for the monthly reset or upgrade to a higher RapidAPI tier. Adding plants you already have in the Recent Plants strip doesn't burn calls.

**Radar profile / care sections are empty on an older plant** — plants added before v1.2.0 don't have the richer data cached. Open the plant once while you still have API calls remaining; Agribuddy fetches the missing data (1 call) and fills it in. If you're out of calls, the profile will populate after the monthly reset.

**Plant card shows blank fields** — the plant might be from before the Verdantly migration. Delete it and re-add via search.

**Status entity stuck at "unknown" / shows a "reconnect" prompt** — the coordinator hasn't completed its first refresh. Wait 5–10 seconds after HA startup. If a plant or plot entity shows a "reconnect" prompt after an upgrade, it should re-bind on the next reload; if it persists, check HA logs for `agribuddy` errors.

**Card version mismatch warning** — the JavaScript and Python versions don't match. Make sure you replaced BOTH the integration directory and the card file, then bump the resource URL cache-buster (`?v=N` → `?v=N+1`) and hard-refresh.

For other issues, check `Settings → System → Logs` and filter for `agribuddy`. The logger is verbose at INFO level.

---

## Privacy

Agribuddy talks to one external API: Verdantly via RapidAPI, only when you search for or add a plant (or when it refreshes an older plant's data the first time you open it). The query sent is the plant name (e.g. "tomato"). No location data, no plant photos, nothing about your installation is transmitted.

Your hardiness zone range is stored locally and never transmitted. Weather data is read entirely from your local HA weather entity. Plant records, events, photos, and overrides live in your HA `.storage/` directory and are never sent anywhere.
